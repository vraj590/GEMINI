RealityCheck Coach — Live Task Tutoring with Verification (Gemini 3 Hackathon)


RealityCheck Coach is a live camera + voice tutor that guides users through real-world tasks using Gemini as an orchestrated agent system, not a chatbot. 
It observes what the user is doing over time, plans the next micro-step, requests evidence, verifies completion, and self-corrects mistakes—producing verification artifacts (before/after proofs, checklists, session report).
