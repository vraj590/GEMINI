This keeps the team aligned under time pressure.

Core rules:

Prioritize laundry and router flows only.

Optimize for three demo paths: correct, incorrect, unclear.

Avoid adding features that cannot be shown live.

Every feature must support the 3-minute demo story.

This file prevents scope creep.
